Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?
Client sockets and server sockets have several different methods available for them, for example,
the server socket can use s.bind(), s.listen() and s.accept() methods, but the client socket can use
s.connect(). But they both can be specified socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM).

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
We get host and port number, for example: 'Connected by ('127.0.0.1', 50448)'

Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
It will return the data with buffer_size 1024

Question 6: Provide a link to your code on GitHub.
